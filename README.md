# Objective
Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Key Questions
- Identify the days and times with the most orders in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- Determine whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders
- What are the different types of customers and how their behaviors differ
- Analyse the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty
- Observe any differences in ordering habits based on a customer´s loyalty status
- Determine any ordering habits based on the region of the customers
- Find any connection between the age and family status in terms of ordering habits
- The different classifications the demographic information, age, income, family status suggest
- Set the different customer profiles to locate differences in ordering habits

# Tools Used
*Language*: Python
*Libraries*: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Spicy
*Software*: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel

# Folder content
The Instacart Basket Analysis has been separated into the following folders:
- Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report
- Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
- Scripts: Holds all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
- Sent to client: Contains the Final Excel Report

# Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning**: Eliminated duplicates, rectified missing values, standardized mixed or inaccurate data types, and rectified outliers/errors.

- **Data Integration**: Prepared and selected data for merging, validated the successful merge, and exported the final merged data as a pkl file.

- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined essential descriptive statistics (maximum, minimum, quartiles, mean, standard deviation) for each variable. Utilized histograms, scatterplots, bar charts, and line charts to understand data distributions.

- **Creation of New Variables**: Grouped data by user, order, and department for detailed exploration. Generated flags indicating user ordering patterns (e.g., 'new customer', 'loyal customer') and demographic information ('vegetarian', 'pet owner'). Validated new data through crosstabs and value counts.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to craft histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked). Customized colors, legends, labels, and annotations for clarity and visual consistency.

- **Results Presentation**: Produced an Excel document explaining responses to sales/marketing queries. Documented data population flow, consistency checks, data cleaning processes, and newly derived columns.
